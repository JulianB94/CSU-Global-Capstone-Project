# CSU-Global-Capstone-Project

This project gathered data film and motion picture data specifically from The Walt Disney Company from the ‘Data World’ data repository. 
The data included film and company financials, film specific information such as directors and characters as well as the name of each film, 
its genre, rating and opening screens when it premiered as well as release date and budget. 
The goal of the project was to identify any potential relationships or patterns within the data through correlation, 
regression and ANOVA testing particularly with a film’s gross revenue. 
The data was first prepped and cleaned for analysis in Python such as switching all null values to zeroes and adding a new numerical field for each of the ratings. 
The data was then moved to SAS Studio where it went through all previously mentioned tests and measured all the different outputs.

Most business problems in analytics particularly in the areas of forecasting and exploratory analytics involve finding relationships and patterns within the data. 
Business areas focused on sales and revenue management are always analyzing data and looking for any new predictors that can assist in forecasting future revenue. 
The forecasts made from these predictors can be used to better plan out business strategies for the future and help ensure the stability and profitability of their operations. 
Businesses operating mainly in these sectors can use this project as the foundation of identifying any potential predictors in their data set. 
Businesses simply have to import their dataset into SAS and make minimal changes to the code for their respective variables of analysis. 
Businesses can also benefit from this project if they need to perform any type of data preparation or data cleanup procedures to a messy dataset. 
Data preparation tools such as Alteryx can be quite expensive for any business. 
This project can help cleanup any type of dataset through Python such as changing data types, adding and deleting columns, and taking care of null values to make the dataset easier to analyze. 
Whether it’s looking for new relationships or patterns within the data or cleaning up and preparing a dataset for modeling and analysis any business can use this project as a strong foundation from basic to advanced data analysis and insight generation.
